'''
plan:
make columns:   distill year, bottle year, distillery, cask makeup, color, nose, palate, finish,
                abv, rating, sgp, region
maybe separate other types of liquors? rums, bourbons, yak, agave, etc
maybe separate angus reviews?
maybe regularize angus scale vs serge scale?
standard NLP prep on each NLP column
encode by distillery?
encode region
encode cask type?
break up sgp into s, g, and p?
